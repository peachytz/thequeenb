<p>Na na na, diva is a female version of a hustla
Of a hustla, of a, of a hustla
Na na na, diva is a female version of a hustla
Of a hustla, of a, of a hustla
Stop the track, let me state facts
I told you gimme a minute, and I'll be right back
Fifty million round the world, and they say that I couldn't get it
I done got so sick and filthy with Benji's, I can't spend it
How you gon' be talking shit?
You act like I just got up in it
Been the number one diva in this game for a minute
I know you read the paper
The one that they call a queen
Every radio 'round the world know me
'Cause that's where I be (first!)
I'm a a diva (hey)</p>

Na na na, diva is a female version of a hustla
Of a hustla, of a, of a hustla
When he pull up, wanna pop my hood up
Bet he better have a six-pack in the cooler
Getting money, divas gettin' money
If you ain't gettin' money, then you ain't got nothing for me
Tell me somethin', (Tell me somethin')
Where yo boss at? (Where yo' boss at?)
Where my ladies up in here that like to talk back?
(That like to talk back)
I wanna see ya (I wanna see her)
I'd like to meet ya (I'd like to meet her)
What you say? (Not to me!)
She ain't no diva (She ain't no diva!)
Na na na, diva is a female version of a hustla
Of a hustla, of a, of a hustla
Na na na, diva is a female version of a hustla
Of a hustla, of a, of a hustla
Since 15 in my stilettos, been strutting in this game
"What's your age?" was the question they asked when I hit the stage
I'm a diva, best believe-a, you see her, she gettin' paid
She ain't calling him a greeter, don't need him her bed's made
This is a stick-up, stick-up
I need them bags or that money
I'ma stick-up, stick-up
You see the mask, where that money?
All my ladies get it up, I see you, I do the same
Take it to another level, no passengers on my plane
I'm a a diva (hey)
I'm a, I'm a a diva (hey)
I'm a, I'm a a diva (hey)
I'm a, I'm a a diva
This is a stick-up, stick-up
I need them bags or that money
Stick-up, stick-up
You see the mask, where that money?
Na na na, diva is a female version of a hustla
Of a hustla, of a, of a hustla
Na na na, diva is a female version of a hustla
Of a hustla, of a, of a hustla
